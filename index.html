			<b>The objective</b>: Burst as many bubbles as you can to get as many points as you can
			in as little time as possible. 
			Single click on a bubble to find out how many points you could get.
			Click it again (or double click) to burst that bubble!
			The bigger the sets of bubbles you burst at a time, the more points you get!
